###
🟢 Phase 1: Foundation + Role Transition (0–3 months)
🎯 Goal


Build cloud language + confidence

Be credible in an Azure-focused support role

✅ Certification

AZ-900 – Azure Fundamentals

Finish it early in the role

Focus on:

Core Azure services

Resource groups

Networking basics (VNets, NSGs)

Identity (you already know this well)

💡 You’re already strong on Entra ID — AZ-900 will validate that.

🧠 On-the-job focus

Actively get involved in:

User & group management in Entra ID

MFA / Conditional Access changes

Basic Azure portal navigation

Shadowing infrastructure/cloud changes

Incident resolution involving Azure services

🔑 Outcome

Your CV now says:

“Infrastructure / Azure support engineer with AZ-900”

🟢 Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Skills (3–6 months)
🎯 Goal

Stop being “identity-only” and become cloud-capable infrastructure support.

🔧 Skills to build on the job

Ask to get exposure to:

Azure Virtual Machines

Storage accounts

Azure networking basics:

VNets

Subnets

NSGs

Intune & Autopilot (if available)

Hybrid identity (AD ↔ Entra ID sync)

🧪 Home lab (very important)

Set up a small Azure lab:

One resource group

One VM

VNet + subnet

Public/private IP

NSG rules

Azure Monitor basics

This is where you learn without fear.

📚 Start learning:

AZ-104 (start studying, don’t rush the exam yet)

Focus areas first:

This is your career-changing cert

Only take it once you’ve:

Worked with Azure resources

Built labs

Seen real incidents

🔧 On-the-job responsibilities to push for

Azure VM builds or modifications

Backup & restore tasks

Monitoring alerts & troubleshooting

Network troubleshooting (NSGs, routing basics)
